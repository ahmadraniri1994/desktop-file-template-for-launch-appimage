# desktop-file-template-to-launch-appimage
An .desktop file template to launch appimage file.
Just fill the blank with your desired input and you can place it to your local path (~/.local/share/applications). As soon as you open your menu launcher, the .desktop file will appear. Don't forget to give it a name and maybe an icon, so you can recognize it. Thanks, happy sharing and doing jobs.
